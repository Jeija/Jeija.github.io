Last week, [my school](https://hoegy.de/) had a project called "Schule als EU" (school as EU) during which the whole school is organized just like the European Union, with autonomous jurisdiction, politics and economy.
Some friends of mine and me coded software that was used to manage the whole project.
On top of that, this software implemented a digital currency that was successfully used by all students for the duration of the project.

You can find more information about the project's "central bank" at [centralbank.eu](https://centralbank.eu/).
The software including documentation is published [on GitHub](https://github.com/jeija/schulealsstaat).
