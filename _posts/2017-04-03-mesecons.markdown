On Christmas Eve 2011, more than 5 years ago, I published the first version of my "Mesecons" mod for the Minecraft clone ["Minetest"](https://www.minetest.net/).
Mesecons adds digital electronics to the game, very similar to what redstone does for Minecraft.
Ever since, Mesecons has been a personal passion of mine and I have spent countless hours improving player experience and eradicating bugs.

Unfortunately, due to my time-consuming University studies and other side projects, I just do not have the time anymore to perform my duties as a maintainer for the Mesecons GitHub repository.
I have thus decided to transfer ownership of the project to the amazing [Minetest-Mods](http://minetest-mods.github.io/) organization that will from now on take care of one of Minetest's most popular mods.

Even though it feels difficult to say farewell to my most longstanding software project, I believe that this will bring advantages for both players and developers in the long run.
And if Mesecons ever needs me, I will stick around and monitor its continued development closely ;)
